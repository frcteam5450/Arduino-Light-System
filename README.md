# Arduino-Light-System

This code is what runs the lighting system on our robot.It
reads the state of the DIO pins 11, 13, and 15 in order to
determine the state of the lighting system. We have various
set patterns to determine what mode we are in such as a
forward and turning traction drive, a strafing mechanum
drive, a shooting subsystem, an aiming aiming, or even a
victory sequence. It not only looks cool but can also help
determine between different states the robot is in.
